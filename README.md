#  Customer Behaviour in Online Retail Transactions


**This comprehensive data analysis tool designed to streamline data exploration, analysis, and visualisation. The tool supports multiple data formats and provides an intuitive interface for both novice and expert data scientists.



## Dataset Content
* The dataset used for this analysis contains information on transactions made by customers through an online retail platform. The dataset includes data:
# Products purchased, 
# Quantity of each product,
# date and time of each transaction, 
# price of each product, 
# unique identifier for each customer who made a purchase, 
# country of purchase. 
This dataset was used to analyze customer behavior and preferences, identify popular products, and optimize pricing and marketing strategies.

## Business Requirements
To provide insights into customer behaviour, popular products, and pricing strategies to improve sales and marketing efforts. 
To achieve this by analysing online retail transaction data from the dataset sourced.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 

## Project Plan

1. Choosing the appropriate method to carry out the analysis from the start wwas important. I chose a method easy for me to understand and aslo to relay outcomes to the end user.
2. Loading data from the csv file downloaded from Kaggle onto a dataframe
3. Extracting and cleaning of the data by handling missing values,removing negative values from the quantity and price columns and also removing duplicates.
4. Tranforamation process involved creating a new column and adding it onto the dataframe .
5. Descriptive Analysis of the cleaned data to give us some correlations between the data cleaned. for example the RFM score.
6. The creation of visuals to further give insights into the exploratory analysis carried out.
7. Give a conclusion on what was derived from the analysis.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

  

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 



## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
